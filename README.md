Problem Statement for Indian Agriculture Analysis Dashboard



1. Problem Statement



India’s agriculture sector faces challenges in analyzing crop production, yield, and land usage across diverse regions. Policymakers and stakeholders need a comprehensive system to evaluate district and state-level agricultural performance, identify top-performing areas, and track trends over time. This analysis is critical for optimizing resource allocation and improving crop productivity.



2. Dataset Description



The dataset, sourced from ICRISAT District Level Data, includes:

	•	Geographical Data: District and state codes, district and state names.

	•	Temporal Data: Year-wise records.

	•	Crop Data: Area, production, and yield for five major crops: Rice, Wheat, Minor Pulses, Sugarcane, and Sunflower.

	•	Aggregated Metrics: Total crop area, production, and yield.



3. Project Objectives



	•	To analyze district-level crop trends, focusing on production, yield, and area.

	•	To identify top-performing states and districts in agriculture.

	•	To provide actionable insights for policymakers through interactive dashboards.



4. Deliverables



	•	Filters for year, state, and district for detailed exploration.

	•	Aggregated metrics summarizing total crop area, production, and yield.

	•	Comparative analyses and rankings of states and districts based on performance.



This unified analysis will support better decision-making and resource optimization for Indian agriculture.
